Here I want to check for the validity of replication orientation data!

I extracted the POLE-mutant sample IDs by looking into the driver muatitions and selected those samples with POLE mutation likelihood above 0.5. 

31 samples were selected. And then as negative control I selected the lung cohort. So the idea is that in POLE-mutants the replication strand asymmetry is more pronounced due to reduced proofreading capacity of DNA polymerase epsilon.
